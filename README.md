CommonRegexRuby
===========

Port of CommonRegex from Python to Ruby

Find all times, dates, links, phone numbers, emails, ip addresses, prices, hex colors, and credit card numbers in a string. 
We did the hard work so you don't have to.

Pull requests welcome!

Usage
------

```python    
>>> from commonregex import CommonRegex
>>> parsed_text = CommonRegex("""John, please get that article on www.linkedin.com to me by 5:00PM 
                               on Jan 9th 2012. 4:00 would be ideal, actually. If you have any 
                               questions, You can reach me at (519)-236-2723 or get in touch with
                               my associate at harold.smith@gmail.com""")
>>> parsed_text.times
['5:00PM', '4:00']
>>> parsed_text.dates
['Jan 9th 2012']
>>> parsed_text.links
['www.linkedin.com']
>>> parsed_text.phones
['(519)-236-2727']
>>> parsed_text.emails
['harold.smith@gmail.com']
```
    
Alternatively, you can generate a single CommonRegex instance and use it to parse multiple segments of text.

```python
>>> parser = CommonRegex()
>>> parser.times("When are you free?  Do you want to meet up for coffee at 4:00?")
['4:00']
```
    
Finally, all regular expressions used are publicly exposed.

```python
>>> from commonregex import email
>>> import re
>>> text = "...get in touch with my associate at harold.smith@gmail.com"
>>> re.sub(email, "anon@example.com", text)
'...get in touch with my associate at anon@example.com'
```
    
Please note that this module is currently English/US specific.
